## User Roles

- **Admin**: Full access to all features including budget management
- **Staff**: Access to schools, events, and accidents (no budget access)

## API Integration

The frontend integrates with the following backend endpoints:

- `/auth/login` - User authentication
- `/schools` - School CRUD operations
- `/events` - Event management with photos
- `/accidents` - Accident records
- `/budgets` - Budget tracking with summaries
- `/province`, `/city`, `/district` - Location data from Indonesian government API

## Interactive Maps Integration

Schools with latitude and longitude coordinates are displayed on an interactive map with:
- **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** (100% free, no API key needed)
- Red marker pins for each school
- Popup windows showing school details on marker click
- Toggle between table and map view
- Zoom and pan functionality

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **React Router v6** - Client-side routing
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **Bootstrap 5** - UI framework
- **Bootstrap Icons** - Icon library
- **React Toastify** - Toast notifications
- **Leaflet + React Leaflet** - Free maps with OpenStreetMap

## Authentication

The application uses JWT token-based authentication:
- Token stored in localStorage
- Automatic token injection in API requests
- Auto-redirect on 401 unauthorized responses
- Protected routes based on user roles

## Notes

- Make sure the backend API is running before starting the frontend
- Maps are provided by OpenStreetMap - completely free, no API key required
- The theme uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization
- All API calls include error handling with toast notifications
